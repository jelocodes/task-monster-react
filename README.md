# Task Monster

## The Idea:

A fun side project combining the functionality of a productivity app, with the fun of a virtual pet. An improvement of an old side-project using newer technologies like React/Redux/Solidity

## How it (will eventually) works: 

You can type in tasks in a form to add them to a To-Do Check List. A monster lives on the screen and has an XP (Experience Points) bar, along with stats. The XP bar fills for each task completed on your To-do list, leveling up your monster's stats with each task completed. Check-off a task by dragging it to, and feeding it to the monster. Complete all of the tasks on your list and the monster gains enough XP to level up and increase its stats. You can also make and save multiple task lists.
